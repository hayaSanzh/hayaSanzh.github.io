Platzi - Your Dream Store

Platzi is an online e-commerce platform where users can browse through various product categories such as shoes, clothes, electronics, and furniture. The platform provides a smooth shopping experience with features like category selection, product browsing, and light/dark mode.
Key Features

    Category Selection: Users can browse through product categories such as shoes, clothes, electronics, and furniture. The selected category is stored in localStorage, ensuring that the user's preference is maintained even after a page refresh or logout.

    Light/Dark Mode: The website offers a light/dark theme toggle that allows users to switch between themes. The selected theme preference is saved in localStorage, so the chosen mode is applied every time the user visits or reloads the site.

    Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap, the website is mobile-friendly and offers a seamless experience across devices.

User Preferences Management

    Category Selection: When users select a category (e.g., shoes or clothes), the choice is saved in localStorage, ensuring that the selected category is remembered even after page refresh or session expiration.

    Theme Preferences: Users can switch between light and dark modes using a toggle button. The selected mode is saved in localStorage and automatically applied upon returning to the site.
